# WatchWithMe!
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ssd71/watchwithme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ssd71/watchwithme)


[WatchWithMe](https://binge-together.herokuapp.com/) is a web application I made out of necessity, while sitting out in the heat of summer in the middle of nowhere, trying to watch anime with a certain _someone_. The instructions are on the webpage itself. To make changes or run the server locally:

- Fork the repository
- Clone the forked repository locally
- Make changes
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`
- `npm run start`
- Pull request

In it's current state, it can only sync up two users playing a local(browser compatible) video file. The files need not be the same, which although does give rise to some ambiguity, I decided not to enforce these limitations since I was going to be actually using slightly different files in my usecase.
Have a good Day , Welcome!
